# TH05 handoff

Read [workflow](RE_WORKFLOW.md) and [acceptance](ORACLES.md), then run
`git status --short` and `python3 scripts/preflight.py`. Continue recovering
both major boss functions and their leaves. Old failed attempts are evidence,
not proof that a different natural source context cannot work.

## Accepted state

336 bounded C/C++ CODE/DATA units, 525 complete function occurrences:
**103,846 authored bytes exact** = 88,502 CODE + 15,344 initialized DATA.
CODE is 87,694 instruction + 808 compiler-table bytes. Complete compared
extents total 103,934, including 88 uncredited padding bytes.

| Artifact | Functions | CODE | Initialized DATA |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MAIN | 406 | 67,316 | 3,098 |
| OP | 62 | 11,251 | 8,649 |
| MAINE | 56 | 9,613 | 3,597 |
| ZUN | 1 | 322 | 0 |

Separate reviewed ASM: 7,020 instruction + 210 dispatch-table + 24 semantic
CODE-coordinate + 64 DATA bytes; 7,388 compared bytes include 70 uncredited.
Vendor CODE/DATA: 73,804/3,777; font resource: 8,192. Unknown ownership remains
**122,173 bytes**, including MAIN 42,463. The global authored denominator and
percentage are unreviewed; the at-least-98% goal is not complete.
[Generated progress](PROGRESS.md) and [ownership](../resources/ownership.json)
are authoritative.

Latest exact recovery: three complete C++ functions/92 instruction bytes plus
seven initialized filename bytes. No table, padding or BSS is newly credited.

| Unit | MAIN scope | Authored bytes | Receipt under `.analysis/unit-replays/` |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `main-bb-playchar` | `[10432,1045B)` | 41 / two functions | `main-bb-playchar-a/receipt.json` |
| `main-bb-playchar-filename` | `[222AC,222B3)` | 7 DATA | same receipt |
| `main-stage2-invalidate` | `[116CD,11700)` | 51 / one function | `main-stage2-invalidate-a/receipt.json` |

Both focused replays pass two deterministic builds, valid OMF, all raw bytes,
original fixups and compiled controls (including the required separate DATA
mutation). See [BB source/ABI review](../src/main/formats/bb_playchar.md) and
[stage-two invalidator](../src/main/stage/stage2_invalidate.md) for receipt
hashes. Complete canonical headers and prior accepted source are unchanged.
The original BB trailing NOP and filename alignment remain outside these
complete contributions and receive no credit.

The stage-two boundary was missed by the old prefix survey's543-byte reference
public spacing: original RET ends at116FF and the accepted initializer begins
at11700. The refined short-prefix routing stays private and is not acceptance.
Its only purpose is to identify complete scopes for native review.

The Cheeto renderer established documented `-G` speed generation as the natural
source context for the original PUSH BP/MOV BP,SP/SUB SP prologue. This also
resolved the former bullet-rendering blocker with ordinary register-qualified
pattern/pointer locals. Shared headers, full types, semantics and hardware
interfaces remain unchanged. [Compiler notes](reconstruction/BORLAND_NOTES.md)
and each source's adjacent Markdown record complete scopes, ABI and receipt
hashes. The previous five explosion-creation functions remain accepted.

Alice's independent callback trials avoid compiling the accepted puppet owner.
Ordinary register declarations restore the native pattern/left allocation;
the joined byte-frame version still emits146 because of a six-byte store/load,
and a simple inline quarter-frame helper emits148 with duplicated division.
Both failed first producers are retained, experimental files removed and
baseline source unchanged. The earlier conditional helper's543-byte combined
failure is historical. [Details](../src/main/boss/alice/foreground.md).
No new Alice credit is claimed; defeat/collision is unchanged.
One new ordinary-register collision diagnostic still emits46 versus43; the
maintained source and binder were restored exactly. A CDG-free-all loop emits15 versus14 because
the genuine far external call retains a relaxation NOP. It is also unaccepted
and its experimental source was removed. Both frozen diagnostic inputs remain
under `.analysis/native-producers/`; no signature or output is patched.

## Useful next work

| Complete native scope | Current evidence | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yumeko sword updater (283 bytes) | Natural C++ emits 280; two merged jumps and a one-byte-longer Y calculation explain the gap. `-O-` and control-flow variants fail. | [Updater](../src/main/boss/yumeko/swords_update.md) |
| Yumeko aimed swords (354) / laser-swords (428) | Both raw-equal; original relocation order differs standalone. Genuine allocator/updater/pattern context restores aimed order but starts three bytes early. `-y` does not fix the standalone order. | [Attacks](../src/main/boss/yumeko/laser_swords.md) |
| Dialog opcode (456 bytes) | Direct compiler emits 455; unchanged compiler-generated ASM assembled with TASM reproduces 456 raw bytes, but reverses original fixup order. No acceptance. | [Interpreter](../src/main/dialog/opcode.md) |
| Staff updater (626) / renderer (861) | Current full-family output 623/858. Declaration, class API, expression and scoped-option trials do not recover the pointer loads; source restored. Fifteen other functions remain accepted. | [Staff family](../src/maine/staff/full.md) |
| Staff controller (991 bytes) | All raw bytes match; standalone fixups form one descending run instead of the original two. Bitmap predecessor (126) still compiles to 211. | [Controller](../src/maine/staff/controller.md) |
| Shinki wing (386) / ball updater (220) | Wing raw-equal with wrong order; ordinary scalar ball candidate 232. | [Wing/balls](../src/main/boss/shinki/wing_preparation.md) |
| B4 ball updater (273 bytes) | Natural 278; eager-delta 290 and cleanup-label 278 alternatives fail. | [B4](../src/main/boss/mai_yuki/b4ball_render.md) |

Generic boss collision (43) and Shinki particle renderer (159) also remain inexact.
Other retained candidates are indexed in
[UNACCEPTED_COHORTS.md](reconstruction/UNACCEPTED_COHORTS.md).
The major boss update callbacks already have accepted owners; do not replay
those unchanged functions while investigating their remaining neighbors.

## Continue incrementally

`python3 scripts/replay_units.py --plan` reports the necessary MAIN closure;
use `--artifact op`, `maine` or `zun` for those manifests. Replay new/affected
units only. Reuse unchanged accepted dependencies and tool execution probes
after checking their identities. Preserve the complete ABI, raw bytes and
original relocation order; never sort or patch the output.

Normal recovery needs no new Python tests, CPU behavior models, allocation
failure/null-pointer checks or per-function supplementary negatives. The normal
replay's shared compiled control is sufficient. Preserve original unchecked
behavior. `python3 scripts/ci.py` is lightweight; `--full` is opt-in for tooling
work. Documentation cleanup needs no compiler replay or progress regeneration.

## Workspace and evidence

No compiler or Ghidra job is running. Current baseline and raw-equal diagnostics
remain under `.analysis/native-producers/`. The private
`single_main_producer.py` / `single_native_producer.py` run one diagnostic
producer, never an acceptance receipt. Wine/Borland/Ghidra remain serialized.
The MAIN incremental plan is empty after the focused BB and stage-two replays.
No whole accepted-set replay was run. Other artifact inputs are unchanged.

Handoff cleanup archived 24 terminal alternative producers plus duplicate
backups and unused assembler extraction. The two obsolete combined wrappers
and their binders were removed; semantic bodies and accepted owners remain.
See [local storage](LOCAL_STORAGE.md) for the archive, restoration commands and
the prior cleanup's 328-record/232-receipt inventory. Subsequent recoveries add
eight records/seven receipts; all accepted evidence stays live.
Retired zero-compare, boss-background and supplemental-negative tools remain
in Git at `3af324e`; they are not part of the active workflow.
